# Album Collection Web API Project

This is a web application using RESTful API with ASP.NET Entity Framework and Node.js. There are two folders, backend and frontend for this project. Using Git Bash on the command line, open up the backend by running Visual Studio and then once it starts, open up the frontend folder in Visual Studio Code. To run the frontend program, in Git Bash run npm start on the command line.

In the backend, a database was created which is for retrieving and storing artists, albums, and songs. Test Driven Development was also used in building out the code for the backend.

In the frontend folder is a SPA (Single Page Application) that uses that users can interact with. Users can create, view, edit and delete artists, songs and albums.
